# Two-Dimensional-Chromosome-Structure-of-Genetic-Algorithm
In this type of solution development, Genetic Algorithm having a two-dimensional array for the structure of the chromosome is applied based on the reference paper of Dean.  This metaheuristic is aimed at solving the second target: maximizing the preferences of staff.
